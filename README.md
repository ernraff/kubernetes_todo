# containerized flask application

Course assignment for Cloud Computing at NYU

Given a to-do flask application, I containerized the application using Docker, created a
persistence volume, and pushed the image to Docker Hub. 

I deployed the container on a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube and then deployed it on AWS EKS.

During the course of this assignment, I explored various Kubernetes features such as a replication controller, health monitoring, and rolling updates.
